# ChatBot__
I am new to Python programming and have always wanted to create a chatbot. While what I have made so far is not yet a fully functional chatbot, I am actively learning and improving my skills in Python. Suggestions and feedback are always welcome!  

I have used some code in the gui part from microsoft copilot. As i found it relaiable for this project.

Tkinter Application - Feature Log and Improvements
Overview
This Tkinter application serves as an interactive GUI, incorporating various elements like buttons, scales, and listboxes. The application is designed to provide users with a simple yet functional interface for different interactions, including clicking buttons, submitting values from a scale, and selecting items from a listbox.

Features Implemented :-
Main Interface: A Tkinter window with a title and minimum size.

Button: A button labeled "Click me" that increments a counter and prints a message each time it is clicked.

Label: A simple label displaying a "Hello" message.

Vertical Scale with Tick Intervals: A vertical scale ranging from 0 to 100 with tick intervals set to 5. The scale value can be submitted using a dedicated button.

Listbox: A listbox that allows users to select items and print the selected values using a button.

Necessary Changes Implemented :-
Corrected Widget Initialization: Ensured that all widgets (like Label, Button, and Scale) are initialized correctly with appropriate parameters.

Function Definitions: Added necessary arguments (like event=None) to functions connected to widgets to handle extra arguments passed by Tkinter.

Consistent Command Linking: Ensured that functions are correctly linked to widget commands without parentheses to prevent errors.

Tick Intervals: Set accurate tick intervals for the vertical scale to ensure proper display of values.

Custom Tick Marks: Manually added custom tick marks to the vertical scale for consistent intervals.

Listbox Functionality: Created a function to handle listbox actions and print selected items.

Future Improvements :-
Error Handling: Implement better error handling and user feedback for invalid inputs or actions.

Advanced Features: Add more advanced features like file dialogs, dynamic content updates, and additional widgets.

Styling and Layout: Improve the GUI styling and layout for a more visually appealing and user-friendly experience.

Data Persistence: Implement features to save user inputs and settings between sessions.


If you want to help me learn about this project it will be a huge help, Thank You.
